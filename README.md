Automate repetitive emails! Send attachments with an Excel data range to the body of your email with one click.

This is a utility to automate tasks associated with sending report emails that require attachments and information in the body of the email that is pasted from a specified Excel range. Put any email attachments in a subfolder named "attachments". The files will be automatically deleted when the email is sent. After you have completed the settings, you only need to press the "send" button. Entering your name to identify yourself as the sender is optional. This is the only setting that will not be stored by the program. This is not copyrighted and it is free for use.
